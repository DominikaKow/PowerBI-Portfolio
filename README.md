Welcome to my Power BI portfolio! Here you can see examples of my Power BI projects and dashboards, which show my abilities in data visualization, business intelligence, and data analysis with Power BI.

## About Me
I am interested in working with data and I enjoy using Power BI. I have experience turning raw data into useful information and making interactive dashboards. I like helping companies understand their data and make better decisions. In this portfolio, you can see my Power BI skills and how I can show complex data in a simple and clear way.

## [Project 1: Monitoring Promotional Errors in Retail Stores](https://)

In this project, I created a Power BI tool to monitor and analyze promotional errors in stationary stores. Errors such as wrong prices, incorrect descriptions, and missing promotions can cause financial losses and damage the companyâ€™s image. Before, there was no central system for reporting errors, and the data was spread across different sources.

#### Solution

I integrated data from different systems, including SAP, customer complaints, and internal forms. The tool automatically classifies errors by type, such as price mistakes, missing labels, or expired promotions. I built an interactive dashboard where users can analyze errors by store, region, type, and product department.

#### Data Sources
+ Error reports from checkout systems, headquarters, and stores
+ Internal forms, emails, and Excel files
+ Customer complaints

#### Scope of Analysis
The analysis covers different error types, such as price differences between checkout and shelf, missing promotions, and wrong labels. It also shows where the error happened (store, region, or the whole chain), the source of the error (headquarters or store), and how long it took to detect and solve the problem.

#### Key Findings
+ Promotional errors have a negative impact on finances, company image, and customer experience.
+ Before this project, error data was fragmented and hard to analyze.
+ Power BI made it possible to manage and analyze error reports in one place.
+ The tool helps the operations, marketing, and quality teams.
+ After implementation, the company saw fewer errors, faster reactions, and better decisions.

This project shows my ability to solve real business problems using Power BI, from data integration to creating useful dashboards and supporting better company performance.
